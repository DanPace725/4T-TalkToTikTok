Divine Bro told a parable, saying, an influencer went on vacation. Before he left, he gave 21 of his bros the logins to his 21 TikTok pages, and said, do your thing, 21. 

One of them had 500K followers, another had 200K, and another had 100K. When he came back, he asked his bros, how are my notifs and DMs doing? 

The bro with the 500K said, I made 500K more followers by doing some yeet skirts and other dance trends. Broski said, let's go. Bro, you wanna collab? 

The bro with the 200K page said, I made 200K more followers by reposting the Mario essay and other memes. Broski said, Ayo, you crushed it. Let's collab. 

Then the bro with the 100K follower page said, BFFR, nobody can work with a mere 100K page, so just turn off your notifs and liked every comment, and that's it. Anyway, you ain't even the collabbing type. 

Then Broski said, bro, I literally just, all right, you know what? Here's my number, and he blocked the lazy ad, bro.
