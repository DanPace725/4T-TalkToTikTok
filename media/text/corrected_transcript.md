Sacred Blood said, when you give alms, don't post it for views, for I tell you, you have received your reward from the TikTok Creators Fund. And similarly, whenever you talk to the Top G, do not post it to your Insta story, nor spam it in the comments hoping to be seen by him, for he always checks every one of his notifications. But rather, slide into his DMs, saying, Our Father, who art the Top G, hallowed be thy vibes. Thy will be done, on the streets as it is in heaven. Secure us this day our daily bag, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, on God. For truly I tell you, if you forgive others who wrong you, God will forgive you for all the mistakes you've made. But if you cancel others, God will hold you accountable for all your actions.
