I was an undiagnosed autistic kid that thought I just had really bad anxiety, and the advice that I was always given was fake it till you make it. So I was unknowingly learning to mask my autism and I was faking it till I made it, and I thought at some point if I worked hard enough my struggles would go away over time. But I didn't make it. I ended up having a major mental breakdown at 20 years old and I got diagnosed with autism. And I'm so happy that I was able to get diagnosed and I love who I am. I love my autistic brain. But the diagnosis sent me into a depression because the diagnosis meant that all the struggles I'd had throughout my whole life were never going to go away. And that really hurt. That was a hard pill to swallow because as a kid I thought if I just worked harder and harder and harder at some point I was going to fix my struggles and life was going to get easier and I wasn't going to feel like that my whole life. And I realized that pushing myself as a little kid to do all these things that I wasn't really capable of doing was kind of just a waste because all it left me was severely burnt out.
