How are we going to get back to the days when somebody can support themselves and live comfortably with just one income? I have a full time job that years ago I could have raised a family on what I make and it's like now I have to do side hustles to supplement my income because it's gotten so fucking expensive to live. Basically you have to work like 75% of your life, like donate, give up 75% of your time pretty much just to literally survive, just to live, not to live comfortably, not to live well, just to live. If you're having people struggling over money, struggling over food, struggling over finding a place to live, what do you think you're going to expect from America? You're going to get more violence. You're going to get more people attacking other people. You're going to get more of the looting in different stores. And then it's like I woke up all of a sudden and my insurance has doubled, food has fucking tripled, gas is so expensive, electric bill over doubled, my fucking rent went up. I can't be the only one that's drowning. Everybody is going through this bullshit. Everyone can't go to Canada, can't go to the UK. Everyone is dealing with just not being able to sustain life. I've never had so little money in my entire life. All of my money goes towards my bills and food for me to eat. And half the time I have to choose between filling my car up with gas or eating. I wish that I could just have a job and do my job and go to work every day and it would just pay for life. It would pay for a roof over my head, it would pay for food on my table, it would pay for medical bills, it would pay enough for me to like save money so I could retire one day, you know, like basic things. I am 36 years old and I have nothing to show for 20 plus years of work. 70,000 a year, not enough? Is a bachelor's degree not enough? Is two jobs not enough? And the only thing we hear is, well stop Starbucks and stop your brunches and your three day vacations. If you get up and take care of your house and take care of your friends and your family and your body and work 50 hours a week plus commuting, don't you think that person deserves a night out or a Sunday? At what point is it literally just too expensive to live? Like when do we, cause we keep on talking about it, we keep on talking about inflation, we keep on talking about salary not meeting it, we keep on talking about the minimum wage, and we keep on talking about all this stuff, but like at what point does that bubble burn? It literally is just too expensive to be alive even if you're working a full time job. I'm so tired of this corrupt ass world bro, it is fucked up. And this shit has to end now.
