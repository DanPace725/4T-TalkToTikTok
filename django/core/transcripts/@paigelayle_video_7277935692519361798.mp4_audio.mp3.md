when i was a kid, my dad, who i think honestly might be a psychopath he always tried to make us seem the same and i was just autistic but he always wanted everyone else to know she's a liar! she's lying! she's manipulating you! she's lying! which like, red flag! i would think as an adult that like an adult is calling a kid a liar but the adults around him were so encapsulated by him they're like, you're right, that kid do be lying and one of the ways where this manipulation and autism like kind of looked the same socially was when he weaponized incompetence very very very irresponsible human being does not want to be responsible for anything and talks his way out of it or if he can't talk his way out of it he finds like the fine print you know, 40 year old man living at a house with his wife and kids and his wife goes like, hey would you clean that pan? you know, like just wash that dish? okay yeah sure honey, you know what my dad would do? the bare minimum maybe just that and then like not dry it not touch any of the other dishes in the sink you know, like just do the bare minimum because he's like, i don't want to why would i want to? i want to- i want to go get drunk mama come home and be like oh you didn't do like the other stuff and he'd be like you didn't tell me to what am i supposed to just like read your mind? you- you just explain things better we wouldn't be in this problem he'd do a poor job of it too you know, so she'd look at it and be like i'll just do it next time i guess you can't do anything right but then the same kind of situation would happen with me and mom would say like hey will you clean the pan? and i'd be like yeah and i was a kid and autistic and took things very literally and when someone says can you clean the pan i don't just assume they want me to clean the other dishes because that's not what i do if i said would you clean the pan i do not want them touching nothing else i don't want them touching anything else or i'd say can you clean all of the other everything that's what i would say because i'm very specific with my wording and so if she's like will you clean this dirty pan i'm like yeah maybe it needs to be cleaned except rocky or the stuff's all gonna get stuck on it i will clean that pan i will mom so into it but then she'd come home and same kind of thing what? you didn't do any of the other dishes now i'm looking there exactly like my dad did exactly what my dad did and i'd say like exactly what my dad would say like i didn't know you didn't say that if you asked me to do the other dishes i would have i'm sorry but like and my dad saw that and was like she is my protege i don't even need to like infiltrate her she's already got it she's already manipulating out of the womb but he wasn't proud no no no my dad like my dad did not like me he stayed far away from me because he knew from a young age because he tried to manipulate me he tried to make me he tried to say those things to me he tried my dad literally shit on the floor and was like page clean that up and i laughed at him because i'm like that's funny and he left it there for like an hour and i was like why is there shit on the floor? and i'm like because you shit on the floor and he said i asked you to clean it up and i said yeah i heard you out loud but you're delusional if you think i'm gonna clean up your poo and he's like clean it up and i'm like no like you're clearly joking right now because that's insane like he fully thought that i was gonna clean up his his shit on the ground he fully thought and he didn't get to it until my mom pulled in the driveway then he's like
