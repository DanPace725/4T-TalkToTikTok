One of the coolest things discovered last week was the oldest ever evidence of fish living in the very deepest parts of the ocean. I loved reading this story, because this entire topic had legitimately never occurred to me, so from my perspective, this isn't just a cool new answer, it's a cool new question. Vertebrate colonization of the abyssal plain. Let's talk about it. The history of our fellow vertebrates colonizing places that were hard to get to yields some pretty famous fossils. When it comes to vertebrate air colonization, I'd say Archaeopteryx is a household name. And then further back in time, there are very good doggies like Tiktaalik, who represent the first vertebrate land colonization. But vertebrates are from the ocean, so I'd never bothered to ask how long it took them to colonize all the different parts of the ocean, including the very deepest parts. Well, until this paper came out, the earliest evidence of fish here was 50 million years ago, which is not only after this, but also after this. The new paper analyzes trace fossils from rock that was once part of an ancient seafloor. Trace fossils are not fossil bodies or body parts, but rather fossils of imprints left by organisms or their behavior. So, things like fossil footprints, fossil poop, or in this case, fossils of holes dug by some little animal on the seafloor. And the paper authors are arguing that these particular traces are most likely left by the behavior of fish. If they're right, then this paper pushes back the date of the earliest evidence of vertebrates in the abyssal zone by 80 million years, which would actually still make it younger than both of these things.
