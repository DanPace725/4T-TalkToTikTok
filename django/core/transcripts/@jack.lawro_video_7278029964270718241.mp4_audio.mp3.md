Look, being alone is an opportunity. You've got to learn to love yourself- Oh, shut up. Just shut up. I'm so tired of this. Look, I'm just trying to help. I know, I know. I get where you're coming from. That you've got to develop a relationship with yourself, because most moments in life are spent alone anyway. Right, okay, so isn't it worth- But here's the capital T truth that you don't appreciate. You can't think your way out of loneliness any more than you can think your way out of a broken leg. We need human contact. In the same way that we need sunlight. Without it, we wither. And look, you can dress up that fact however you like. You can do all the therapy, sort out all your issues, get the best attachment style they have available. But it's not going to change the fact that when you get home at the end of the day, you'll be confronted with it. Loneliness. And much like total darkness, there's no texture to that feeling. No intrigue you can find within it. There's no substance. It's just an absence. Some people are perfectly happy alone. But that's not me, is it? Why can't you just accept some stark realities without having to put a spin on it? It makes these conversations so difficult. I just don't see any point in sitting in melancholy. What if all the philosophical repositionings you offer me are actually just psychological coping mechanisms? Just a cover-up. A nicotine patch. You know, some people deal with loneliness through TV, movies, music. And what do I do? Rationalisation. Self-talk. They're all just supplements. I don't know what you think is wrong. Makes you wonder how many philosophical and psychological problems came about just because someone needed a hug, huh? Why are you so quiet? Yeah.
