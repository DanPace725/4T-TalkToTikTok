Hey, can you organize this for me? Uh, yeah sure. How do you want me to organize all this? Oh, it doesn't matter. I just need it all done. Okay. Here you go. I'm all done and it's all organized. What is this? Why did you organize it by size? This is not what I wanted. Well, why did you say that then? You said it didn't matter. I'm sorry. Hey, can you do me a favor and go turn over the laundry for me? Yeah, sure. All done. I turned over the laundry for you. That was really fast. Did you fold the clothes that you took out of the dryer? Uh, no. Well, why not? Because you told me to turn over the laundry, meaning taking the clothes out of the dryer and then putting the clothes from the washer into the dryer. Okay, yeah, but it's implied that you're supposed to then fold those clothes that you took out of the dryer. What, are you just going to leave them in the bin? Well, if you said fold the clothes, I would have folded the clothes. Hey, can you tidy up the living room for me at some point today? Yeah, sure. Morgan, I come home and you haven't tidied up the living room like I asked? Well, you said at some point today. It's still today. It's only like four o'clock. Yeah, but I expected it to be done when I got home. I'm sorry. I didn't know there was like a time limit on it. I thought some point today just meant like any point today, but I can go do it right now.
